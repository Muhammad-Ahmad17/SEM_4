# E-Commerce Business Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This project aims to build a complete full-stack analytics dashboard for an e-commerce platform. It integrates a SQL Server database, Express.js API, Python-based analytics, and a modern frontend interface to deliver actionable insights using real business data.

---

## Project Objectives
- Develop a normalized relational database schema for an e-commerce platform
- Perform advanced SQL analytics to uncover trends and patterns
- Integrate Python for visual reporting and deeper analysis
- Build APIs using Node.js for seamless data flow
- Create a responsive frontend dashboard to visualize KPIs and trends

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- *SQL Server* (for relational database and analytics)
- *Node.js + Express* (RESTful APIs for data access)
- *Python* (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for analytics and plotting

### Frontend
- *React.js* (or Angular if preferred)
- *Chart.js / Recharts / D3.js* (for dynamic visualizations)
- *Axios* (to consume APIs)

---

## System Architecture

User → Frontend Dashboard ↓↑ React + Charts ↓↑ Node.js API (Express) ↓↑               →  Python Analytics API (charts/images/JSON) SQL Server (Orders, Products, Users, etc.)

---

## Data Model (EERD)

### Core Tables:
- Users (user_id, name, email, region)
- Products (product_id, name, price, category_id)
- Categories (category_id, name)
- Orders (order_id, user_id, order_date, total_amount)
- OrderItems (order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
- Returns (return_id, order_item_id, reason, return_date)
- Carts (cart_id, user_id, created_at)
- CartItems (cart_item_id, cart_id, product_id, quantity)

---

## SQL Analytics

### Example Insights
- Monthly Revenue Trend
- Top-Selling Products by Region
- Abandoned Cart Ratio
- Return Rate by Product
- Average Order Value per Category
- RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Customer Lifetime Value
- Inventory Pressure Zones

### Sample Complex Queries
- CTEs, JOINs, GROUP BY, Subqueries, CASE, Date Functions, Window Functions

---

## Python Analytics (Connected via Separate API)

### Tasks:
- Load SQL data using Python (via SQLAlchemy/pyodbc)
- Perform advanced analytics using pandas
- Generate:
  - Line/Bar graphs
  - Pie charts for categories
  - Heatmaps (e.g., hourly sales)
- Serve analytics images or JSON via Flask/FastAPI endpoints

### Example Endpoint:
```bash
GET /analytics/monthly-revenue

Returns revenue trend graph or dataset.


---

API Structure

Express.js Endpoints:

/api/orders

/api/products

/api/top-customers

/api/abandoned-carts


Python API (Flask):

/analytics/monthly-revenue → chart image or JSON

/analytics/return-rate

/analytics/category-sales


Frontend uses both for different visualizations.


---

Frontend Dashboard Features

Total revenue, order count, avg order value (KPI cards)

Interactive filters (date range, region, category)

Dynamic charts: Sales trend, Product breakdown, Customer insights

Risk zone: High return rate products, peak load hours



---

Security Measures

Input validation & parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

Auth tokens (optional for demo)

Separate concerns via API design (Express & Python isolated)



---

Why This Project?

Demonstrates complex SQL analysis

Combines backend logic, Python analytics, and frontend

A portfolio-ready, scalable architecture

Can be extended to include ML, user roles, or fraud detection in future



---

Bonus Extensions (Optional)

Export data as CSV/PDF

Email reports

Integrate user roles (admin, analyst)

Schedule analytics (Python script on cron job)

Final Notes

This project perfectly fits a database-oriented portfolio with cross-functional integration across:

Data engineering (SQL)

Backend API design

Python analysis

Frontend visualization


You’ll gain practical experience on real-world business data flow — all in one showcase app.
